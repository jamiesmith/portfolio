# Jamie Smith's Portfolio

Here's an example of some of the public-facing collateral that I've put together over the past few years.

* The [index](https://snyk.io/contributors/jamie-smith/) of my blogs from Snyk. The list includes thought leadership pieces, some feature launches, and technical deep-dives of zero-day vulnerabilities.  
  * This [article](https://snyk.io/articles/software-supply-chain-security/) about software supply chain security, which was used as a landing page in a campaign  
* These product/solution pages were my words and layout (the design team stylized my screenshots)  
  * [The Container Product landing page](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/)  
  * [The Software Supply Chain Security Solution landing page](https://snyk.io/solutions/software-supply-chain-security/)  
    * we also created a one-pager variant of this page which was used as a virtual handout for webinars  
* A couple example webinars from Elastic (note that Snyk doesn't really keep webinars for collateral):  
  * [Evolution of logging with the Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/archive/2021/solution-series/emea/evolution-of-logging-with-the-elastic-stack)  
  * [Combining logs, metrics, and traces for unified observability](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/archive/2021/event/north-america/combining-logs-metrics-and-traces-for-unified-observability) (I also packaged this one up for sales engineers to present at meetups and customer presentations, and it was used dozens of times)  
* There is also [an index](https://www.elastic.co/blog/author/jamie-smith) of my blogs from Elastic  
* In particular, this [APM how-to blog](https://www.elastic.co/blog/monitoring-applications-with-elasticsearch-and-elastic-apm) from Elastic, which was the overall top observability blog for hits- we used this a LOT- for onboarding, nurture flows, CTA, etc  
* I wrote the script, storyboarded the animations (a firm did them), and narrated this [Elastic Observability Overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCX24hRBULY), which was on the solution landing page for over a year
