    <h1>Jamie Smith's Portfolio</h1>
<p>Here's an example of some of the public-facing collateral that I've put together over the past few years.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://snyk.io/contributors/jamie-smith/">index</a> of my blogs from Snyk. The list includes thought leadership pieces, some feature launches, and technical deep-dives of zero-day vulnerabilities.
<ul>
<li>This <a href="https://snyk.io/articles/software-supply-chain-security/">article</a> about software supply chain security, which was used as a landing page in a campaign</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These product/solution pages were my words and layout (the design team stylized my screenshots)
<ul>
<li><a href="https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/">The Container Product landing page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://snyk.io/solutions/software-supply-chain-security/">The Software Supply Chain Security Solution landing page</a>
<ul>
<li>we also created a one-pager variant of this page which was used as a virtual handout for webinars</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A couple example webinars from Elastic (note that Snyk doesn't really keep webinars for collateral):
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/archive/2021/solution-series/emea/evolution-of-logging-with-the-elastic-stack">Evolution of logging with the Elastic Stack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/archive/2021/event/north-america/combining-logs-metrics-and-traces-for-unified-observability">Combining logs, metrics, and traces for unified observability</a> (I also packaged this one up for sales engineers to present at meetups and customer presentations, and it was used dozens of times)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is also <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/author/jamie-smith">an index</a> of my blogs from Elastic</li>
<li>In particular, this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/monitoring-applications-with-elasticsearch-and-elastic-apm">APM how-to blog</a> from Elastic, which was the overall top observability blog for hits- we used this a LOT- for onboarding, nurture flows, CTA, etc</li>
<li>I wrote the script, storyboarded the animations (a firm did them), and narrated this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCX24hRBULY">Elastic Observability Overview video</a>, which was on the solution landing page for over a year</li>
</ul>
